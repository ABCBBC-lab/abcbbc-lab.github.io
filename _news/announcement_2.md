Seal pup born with a full set of teeth. The pup, named "Toothy," was born at the local aquarium and has been attracting visitors with its unique dental condition. Veterinarians are monitoring Toothy's health closely, as this rare occurrence has not been documented in seals before. Despite the unusual teeth, Toothy is thriving and has become a beloved member of the aquarium family.

Seals are marine mammals that belong to the family Phocidae. Native to both hemispheres, these pinnipeds are found primarily in cool waters ranging from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Seals are highly specialized swimmers with a streamlined body and flippers, allowing them to dive to impressive depths and hold their breath for extended periods.

Most seal species typically have teeth adapted for gripping slippery prey like fish and squid. Their teeth usually develop gradually as they mature, making Toothy's rare condition of being born with a full set of teeth truly exceptional. Seals are intelligent, social creatures that communicate through various vocalizations and are known for their playful behavior both in the wild and in captivity.
