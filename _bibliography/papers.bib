  abstract = {Rhythm is fundamental in many physical and biological systems. Rhythm is relevant to a broad range of phenomena across different fields, including animal bioacoustics, speech sciences, and music cognition. As a result, the interest in developing consistent quantitative measures for cross-disciplinary rhythmic analysis is growing. Two quantitative measures that can be directly applied to any temporal structure are the normalized pairwise variability index (nPVI) and rhythm ratios (rk). The nPVI summarizes the overall isochrony of a sequence, i.e., how regularly spaced a sequence's events are, as a single value. Meanwhile, rk quantifies ratios between a sequence's adjacent intervals and is often used for identifying rhythmic categories. Here, we show that these two rhythmic measures are fundamentally connected: the nPVI is a summary static of the rk values of a temporal sequence. This result offers a deeper understanding of how these measures are applied. It also opens the door for creating novel, custom measures to quantify rhythmic patterns based on a sequence's rk distribution and compare rhythmic patterns across different domains. The explicit connection between nPVI and rk is one further step towards a common quantitative toolkit for rhythm research across disciplines.},

  abstract = {How did rhythm originate in humans, and other species? One cross-cultural universal, frequently found in human music, is isochrony: when note onsets repeat regularly like the ticking of a clock. Another universal consists in synchrony (e.g. when individuals coordinate their notes so that they are sung at the same time). An approach to biomusicology focuses on similarities and differences across species, trying to build phylogenies of musical traits. Here we test for the presence of, and a link between, isochrony and synchrony in a non-human animal. We focus on the songs of one of the few singing primates, the lar gibbon (Hylobates lar), extracting temporal features from their solo songs and duets. We show that another ape exhibits one rhythmic feature at the core of human musicality: isochrony. We show that an enhanced call rate overall boosts isochrony, suggesting that respiratory physiological constraints play a role in determining the song's rhythmic structure. However, call rate alone cannot explain the flexible isochrony we witness. Isochrony is plastic and modulated depending on the context of emission: gibbons are more isochronous when duetting than singing solo. We present evidence for rhythmic interaction: we find statistical causality between one individual's note onsets and the co-singer's onsets, and a higher than chance degree of synchrony in the duets. Finally, we find a sex-specific trade-off between individual isochrony and synchrony. Gibbon's plasticity for isochrony and rhythmic overlap may suggest a potential shared selective pressure for interactive vocal displays in singing primates. This pressure may have convergently shaped human and gibbon musicality while acting on a common neural primate substrate. Beyond humans, singing primates are promising models to understand how music and, specifically, a sense of rhythm originated in the primate phylogeny.},

  abstract = {Vocal individuality has important biological functions in mammals: at crucial stages of development, it ensures feeding and is a prerequisite for auditory-based mother--pup recognition. Is vocal individuality only shaped by maturation or also by the degree of conspecific acoustic input? Here, we test how the neonatal auditory environment shapes development and individualization of calls in harbour seal pups (Phoca vitulina). To simulate low- versus high-conspecific acoustic density, 18 pups heard playbacks of calls from either 2 or 30 conspecifics. We recorded calls before and after playback exposure and extracted 12 acoustic parameters. Supervised machine learning and discriminant function analyses showed greater individual distinctiveness in both groups after playback, indicating a developmental trend toward individualization. Notably, pups exposed to less-variable input showed higher individuality. Euclidean distances on call parameters showed that both groups diverged from the playback signals. Distances on within-pup and between-pups housed together revealed opposite trajectories in the two groups: after the exposure, less-variable auditory input determined steadier individual calls, while more-variable auditory input scattered calls across the acoustic space. Altogether, our findings indicate that auditory input modulates vocal development in pups, making harbour seals a promising model for unravelling how neonatal environment affects vocal plasticity in a non-human mammal.This article is part of the theme issue `Mechanisms of learning from social interaction'.},

  abstract = {Structure in musical rhythm can be measured using a number of analytical techniques. While some techniques---like circular statistics or grammar induction---rely on strong top-down assumptions, assumption-free techniques can only provide limited insights on higher-order rhythmic structure. I suggest that research in music perception and performance can benefit from systematically adopting phase space plots, a visualization technique originally developed in mathematical physics that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. By jointly plotting adjacent interonset intervals (IOI), the motivic rhythmic structure of musical phrases, if present, is visualized geometrically without making any a priori assumptions concerning isochrony, beat induction, or metrical hierarchies. I provide visual examples and describe how particular features of rhythmic patterns correspond to geometrical shapes in phase space plots. I argue that research on music perception and systematic musicology stands to benefit from this descriptive tool, particularly in comparative analyses of rhythm production. Phase space plots can be employed as an initial assumption-free diagnostic to find higher order structures (i.e., beyond distributional regularities) before proceeding to more specific, theory-driven analyses.},

  abstract = {Rhythm processing deficits in developmental dyslexia (DD) span across different rhythmic subcomponents and are difficult to capture using one experimental paradigm. How are dyslexic deficits related to motor periodicity, i.e., the execution of repetitive actions while internally generating rhythm? The present experiment investigated rhythm production in DD by means of unprompted tapping paradigm, testing the hypothesis that the ability to internally generate rhythmic patterns may be impaired. The tasks involved tapping of isochronous sequences at a comfortable and a fast tempo and tapping of a free rhythm. Forty adolescents diagnosed with DD (with or without comorbid dyscalculia) participated, along with thirty typically developing control participants. A background questionnaire gathered information about participants' prior music training. The data show that both dyslexic groups tapped faster than the typically developing participants at the comfortable tempo. We found no statistical differences between groups in fast isochronous tapping or in the free rhythm production tasks, irrespective of music training or the presence of dyscalculia. All participants favored regular rhythms when tapping a free rhythm, with a notable preference for isochrony. These results have theoretical and clinical implications for rhythm deficit hypotheses of DD.},

  abstract = {Humans are keen pattern-seekers and take advantage of regularities present in their environment. In the temporal domain, we may call these patterns rhythms, but what is rhythm? Definitions vary, but all presuppose a categorical distinction between rhythm and randomness. Here, we challenge this view and show that two types of random sound sequences---classically considered arrhythmic by experimenters---differ in the amount of regularity humans reconstruct from them. When asked to synchronize to randomly timed sounds, participants leverage statistics to estimate the underlying tempo of the sequence, similar to linear statistical estimators. Theoretically, our results challenge current definitions of rhythm by showing that rhythmicity and randomness are instances of a continuum. Methodologically, our data and mathematical model show that a common method for creating random timing, namely the jittering of event onsets, introduces an undesirable regularity that humans readily exploit. New experiments should aim to maximize temporal randomness, and past experiments' outcomes require reconsideration.},
